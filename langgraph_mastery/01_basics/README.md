# LangGraph Basics

This section covers the fundamental concepts of LangGraph and how to use it with Google's Generative AI models.

## Learning Objectives

- Set up the LangGraph environment
- Understand the core concepts of LangGraph
- Create a simple agent using Google's Generative AI
- Learn about agent states and workflows
- Implement basic tools for your agent

## Contents

1. **01_setup.py** - Environment setup and configuration
2. **02_simple_agent.py** - Creating your first LangGraph agent with Google Gemini
3. **03_basic_tools.py** - Adding tools to your agent
4. **04_simple_workflow.py** - Understanding basic workflows in LangGraph

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have installed all dependencies from the root `requirements.txt`
2. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` template and add your Google API key
3. Run each script in order to understand the concepts progressively

## Key Concepts

- **LangGraph**: A framework for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs
- **Agents**: Autonomous entities that can perform tasks using LLMs and tools
- **Tools**: Functions that agents can use to interact with external systems
- **Workflows**: Directed graphs that define the flow of information and control in an agent system
